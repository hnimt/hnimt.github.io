# High-performance MySQL (Part 1)

## Optimizing Schema and Data Types

### Choosing Optimal Data Types
- Smaller is usually better: Smaller data types are usually better. Because they use less space on disk, in memory, and in CPU cache. They also require fewer CPU cycles to process.
- Avoid NULL if possible: Make indexes, index statistics, and value comparisons more complicated.
- Real Number: Only use Decimal when you want exact calculated data.
- String Types:
  - VARCHAR: Dynamic sized in innoDB engine. Worth it when the maximum column length is much larger than the average length.
  - CHAR: Fixed length in innoDB engine. Useful if you want to store very short strings, or if all the values are nearly the same length.
